# Zero-Point-Research
TL;DR: An open research and documentation archive exploring zero-point energy, quantum vacuum fields, and information-based models of spacetime, with clear separation between established physics and theoretical speculation.

This repo is a structured research archive on zero-point energy, quantum vacuum phenomena, and information-theoretic interpretations of fundamental physics.

An open, rigor-focused archive examining zero-point energy, vacuum fields, and speculative future technologies grounded in quantum physics.

This repository will serve as an open, educational research archive focused on the study of zero-point energy (ZPE), zero-point fields (ZPF), and zero-point information (ZPI).

It will document established quantum mechanical and quantum field theory foundations, experimentally verified vacuum phenomena, and clearly labeled theoretical or speculative extensions. The project emphasizes scientific rigor, transparent sourcing, and strict separation between accepted physics and exploratory ideas, serving as a reference for students, researchers, and developers interested in quantum vacuum science.

This repo will also serve as an archive for all things "Zero-Point".
